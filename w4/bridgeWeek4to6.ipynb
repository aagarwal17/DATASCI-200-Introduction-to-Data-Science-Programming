    "\n",
    "<p>An algorithm accepts an input, returns a true result, and stops.  Stated more CS-y, it is unambiguous (each step and I/O is clear, leading to one meaning); accepts input (0+ well-defined inputs); generates output (1+ outputs that are accurate); finite (must stop after a certain number of steps); be feasible (within the available tech); and independently documented (step-by-step directions [modularization] that is independent of any particular programming language).  </p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <b>Modularization</b>: breaking down the task at hand into logically-related actions; then breaking down those actions into smaller actions that accept data [from a “source”], affect the data, and/or move the data elsewhere [to a “sink”].  </p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "IMHO, we are concerned about good code ‘cause good code is just darn right beautiful but also we consider that when using large, unknown data sets there comes a point where hardware must be considered.  This leads to hardware/software combos called “information ecologies” like Hadoop and other approaches.  [See the Big Data book from EMC2 in our optional resources folder, as well as the Sipser text book <i>Introduction to the theory of computation</i> - this is the standard grad school first-year text.]</p>\n",

    "<b>Before or after?</b><br />\n",
    "We look at our algorithms’ potential efficiencies before the fact (aka a priori, where the algorithm is measured assuming many  factors are constant - like the processor speed and other situation-specific issues); or look at them after the fact (a posteriori, where stats are used to measure the impact of the algorithm’s performance as well as running speed, ram/disk space needs, etc., are all collected).</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Algorithm performance is only an issue when there’s a lot of data to be processed - in fact there are algorithms that work great when the data set is small and then work poorly when the set is large, and vice versa.  Since it’s only large data sets that are the issue, this is called asymptotic.</p>\n",

Time complexity is the amount of time to run - considered by its best runtime (Big &Omega;), its worst-case scenario (Big O) or its average runtime (Big &Theta;).  (Comparison of the same functionality in some testing is called small &omicron;.)</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    If we have <i>n</i> steps and time <i>T</i>, then <i>T(n)</i> is the time needed for the steps of our algorithm.  If it takes n = 5 steps to do some task (each step takes the same amount of time), then we could say our algorithm runs at T(5).  The total number of computations, c, times the number of steps n, means T(n) = c • n.  If each step is constant, then T(n) grows linearly.  [Steps can be very varied … ]\n",
