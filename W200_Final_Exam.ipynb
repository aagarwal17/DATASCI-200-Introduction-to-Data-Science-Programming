Inheritance: Inheritance is basing the class Cart or method add_to_cart on another class or object. The add_to_Cart method doesn't directly demonstrate inheritance. It would if the Cart class inherits from another class or if MobileDevice and Superclass inherit from a common superclass (as this would allow them to be treated interchangeably in the method). Thus, if the two objects--MobileDevice and ServiceContract--inherit from a common superclass, then the add_to_cart method demonstrates Inheritance.\n","2. Polymorphism: Yes - since the method can accept different types and behave differently depending on the type, this demonstrates polymorphism. \n","3. Object-Oriented programming: Yes - this is object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is a style of programming that identifies classes of objects that are closesly linked with the methods they are associated with. The code is using classes and objects and encapsulating functionality within methods, which are principles of OOP. \n","4. Top-down design: No - top-down design means starting with the general concept and breaking it down into smaller, more specific parts. This technique doesn't seem apparant in the method, it is simply adding items to a cart and calculating the total. \n","5. Functional programming: No - Functional programming is a programming paradigm that uses functions and expressions to build computer programs. In this method, we are not passing functions as arguments to other functions (treating functions as first-class citizens). This method is just performing a function."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JdTWk7xZg7Ta"},"source":["b) Suppose you have a long list of digits (0-9) that you want to write to a file.

This means ASCII is limited to 256 characters, while UTF-8 can encode 1,112,064 characters. Knowing this, it would be sensibly more efficient to use ASCII encoding considering storage since UTF-8 can potentially use more bits for certain characters. From my research, however, both ASCII and UTF-8 use the same 7-bit representation for the digits 0-9, so there wouldn't be a different in storage then. The msot efficient way to create an even smaller file to store the information would be to compress the file, as these significantly reduce the file size by removing unnecessary data or using algorithms to encode data more efficiently, saving space and reducing time and bandwidth for uploading and downloading files.

There are many sanity-checks you could perform, but in general, you should look at all of the fields and their datatypes to validate everything is present and filled (ex: info function), look at the distributions of values within the coumns to verify the values make sense (numerically and/or contextually; ex: describe function), look for any inconsistencies or outliers within the data, and look for any duplicates and choose a method to deal with them. \n","\n","It is important to sanity-check your data before beginning your analysis because it ensures the subsequent analaysis will be done on good (reliable/accurate) data, which means more accurate results (more trustworthy). It also ensures the data quality is brought to its highest point right from the beginning, so that subsequent procedures also use the high quality data. Next, data that is sanity-checked from the start avoids having to deal with issues later down the line during the analysis, savign time.\n","\n","If you don't sanity check your data, you could end up with incorrect conclusions or decisions due to the potentially inaccurate data. At the very least, the outcomes may be not as clearly apparant/validated due to the lack of quality data.

What strategy will you use to robustly extract and filter your data of interest? How do you plan to handle missing data?\n","\n","* A good way to start is to print out each line, then practice parsing them to see if you can recover the fields of interest\n","\n","* A starting solution for parsing .vcfs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dceoy/99d976a2c01e7f0ba1c813778f9db744 This solution does **NOT** work due to the changes we've made but can be modified to work. As with any solution that needs modifications, it may take less time to make your own solution!\n","\n","* Filter out junk and lines with no mutation data. Just focus on the data your need to deliver to your boss. \n","\n","* Pandas and NumPy parsers correctly recognize the end of each line in in the ClinVar file.\n","\n","* The unit of observation of this dataset is one row per mutation.\n","\n","* This is similar to a task that one of us tackled at work.

to only contain integers, based on the column description. Since there were some values that contained an ‘O’, I made the assumption that this was supposed to be changed to a ‘0’. I next made the assumption that the data was tabulated correctly; that is, the values in each row were in the correct order based on the order seen in the txt document. I did try looking through the dataframe I created to make sure it looked right, and it did seem fine to me. I made a similar assumption with subsequent columns I made, including GENEINFO, CLNSIG, and CLNDN (that is, in the INFO column, if these strings appeared in that value, the part after the colon for the given string was the correct value). The next assumption I made is that, since the FILTER and QUAL columns were completely empty, they weren’t needed and could be removed (validated by the instructions not including them in the final dataframe for the boss). Moving on, after checking the unique values in the columns, we assumed the values seen for REF, ALT, and GENEINFO were as they were supposed to be and did not require any cleaning. We Also assumped that for the CLNDN and CLNSIG columns, we want to change 'not_specified' or 'not_provided' to 'Not_Given'. Since the importance of the CLNSIG column is to identify those rows that we want to classify as dangerous, we assumed that we could clean this column to remove any numbers, colons, whitespace, and vertical bars, as we only care about the key words that explain the danger level. We also replaced underscores with spaces and turned the words into Sentence Case to make them more readable. Based on our understanding of the definitions of the key words in the CLNSIG column, we assumed only those column values that contained Pathogenic or Risk Factor would mean that the row should be classified as dangerous. The reasoning behind the assumptions for each of the key words found in this column are provided in a markdown cell above. We finally assumed that if the value contained the word ‘conflicting’, we did not have enough information to justify keeping this in the data as dangerous."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_r9uXf94g7Ts"},"source":["4) Findings / What would you present to your boss?\n","\n","I would present the final dataframe with 100 of the 19,688 dangerous mutation instances, containing the Gene Name, Mutation Id, Chromosome, Position, Reference Base, Alternate Base, Clinical Significance, and Disease Name. We found that, while there were 102,321 rows in the provided data, only 19,688 rows/mutation instances could be classified as dangerous. That is, about 20% of the data could be clearly identified as dangerous mutations, based on our assumptions mentioned above. I would let the boss know that the actual number of dangerous mutations may be much higher than this amount since there was a lot of uncertainty with words like “Association”, “Affects”, “Other”, “Uncertain Significance”, ‘Conflicting…”, and “Not Given”. We are also not positive if it is safe to label a mutation as dangerous just based on our understanding of the key words within the CLNSIG column. If we could know more about the missing/unlabeled data, we would be able to make more accurate conclusions."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
