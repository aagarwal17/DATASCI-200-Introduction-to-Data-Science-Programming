    "This part of the exam consists of four programming questions. You have 48 hours to complete both parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Please insert each function into a file named **midterm.py** and upload to gradescope in Part 2. **The code version uploaded to Part 2 will be your official version for grading purposes.**\n",

You can submit as many times as your like inside the window but if you submit over the window, we will take the last submitted entry before the window expired. The visible autograder tests check only that your code is producing the correctly formatted answer. That is, you will only see 20 of the 60 total points visible in the autograder when you submit - the remaining 40 of 60 points are not visible so please make sure your code meets all of the requirements stated in the problem.\n",
